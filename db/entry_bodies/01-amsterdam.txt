<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>Thirteen hours of combined flight, the stale air, and cloudy views were suddenly stricken from mind as we stepped out of Centraal Station and looked out on Amsterdam for the first time. Beyond a canal, a brick church towered over grocery stores and touist shops. Canal boat rental and tour signs were posted every twenty meters or so. To the right was a three story bike parking lot. People rushed pass us in and out of the station as we stood, mouths agape, and tried to take in the city. Many&nbsp;of the people hurrying around us were also wearing 40-80L backpacks as I was, snapping photos and smiling.</p>
<p>First order of business after we regained our bearings was to unpack in the apartment before exploring the city. We had the address, 12 Singel, but no idea what we were looking for. We walked up and down Singel for 20 minutes before we realized the entrance to the apartment was a simple, non-descript black door hidden in plain sight between a Coffeeshop, The Bulldog, and a seed and accessory store. Although we had now found it, we realised we had no key or other way to get in. Mom managed to get one of the property managers on the phone and he agreed to meet us at 14.</p>
<p>With that settled, we headed to Albert Heijn, a local market I had read sold&nbsp;pre-packed lunches for cheap. In addition to regular grocery store stuff, they also sold voetbols (soccer balls) for&nbsp;6.50. There was a french cafe a few streets over that looked welcoming,&nbsp;so we stopped for lunch/breakfast. An orange cat wandered between tables and visited us as we waited for our food. Apple bacon pancakes are exactly as delicious as they sound. I also learned that ‘still’ water is non-carbonated water that is served in a bottle like a water bottle you’d buy from a US grocery store.</p>
<p>Mom and I parted ways after lunch. She went back to the apartment to wait for the manager, and I headed to Dam Square &mdash; so named because it was a square built near the Amstel river dam &mdash; to find a free tour of Amsterdam I had read of on Reddit. The tour encouraged donations, which I gave, but did not charge anything for those that could not, or didn’t want to, pay.</p>
<p>Lars-Hendric guided a group of 30 or so through or to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Red Light District</li>
<li>The peak of Mount Amsterdam (elevation 2m above sea level)</li>
<li>Bloedstrat (Bloodstreet, so named because blood would flow down it in the days of public executions)</li>
<li>A few churches</li>
<li>The Anne Frankhuis</li>
<li>A cheese shop</li>
<li>The thinnest home in Amsterdam</li>
</ul>
<p>He was a funny, knowledgable guide and I wholeheartedly recommend NewEurope Tours to anyone who is in one of the cities they give tours in.</p>
<h3>Bikes</h3>
<p>I’m sure you have heard Amsterdam is a bit into bikes. I even thought I knew what it would be like before I arrived and walked the canals. The truth is, bikes are nearly-silent human rockets that exist for two reasons: to go wherever they damn well please, and to startle goofy tourists by sneaking up on them and ringing their bells. Every bike has a bell. It is used for alerting people around you that the bike will not be stopping, and that they should move out of the way. I am convinced the brakes are merely decorative. Almost every bike is a cruiser model with a rack in the back. Most also have panniers and a milk create on their handlebars. Some Eben had a wooden wheel-barrow-like tub between the front wheel and the handle bars. These are used to seat children and haul heavy or large loads. I saw relatively few mountain or road bikes when I was there.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;eventually made&nbsp;it back to the apartment around&nbsp;17 and rested before the Red Light District tour. The apartment was up two flights of nearly vertical stairs and overlooked Centraal Station, a canal, and the central shopping area. It was directly above a coffeeshop, The Bulldog. The breeze we got through the windows was very distinct.</p>
<h3>Red Light District Tour</h3>
<p>Fascinating and very entertaining. Lars-Hendric led a group of about half new people and half people I recognized from the first tour. When we would walk from one talking point to the next I talked with Julia and her brother whose name I did not write down and sadly now escapes me. We passed condom stores, sex toy and bondage shops, and open windows with bikini-clad girls posing for the crowds. We also walked through the gay S&amp;M district and were cheered at&nbsp; by a group of drunk Brits. In no particular order, I learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>The bargaining starts from around 50 euros which includes a blowjob followed by sex. The price goes up from there depending on what you negotiate with the girl beforehand.</li>
<li>The Catholic church sold absolvements which were essentially ‘get-out-of-sin’ cards that started as a way for rich businessmen to pay the church in order to not have to go on the crusades. There is a church within the Red Light District that saw a lot of this business.</li>
<li>The 2 euro peep show is not worth your money.</li>
<li>The girls are all self-employed and must register with the city&nbsp;as freelance workers. It is essentially a private business in which they keep all profits.</li>
<li>The gay S&amp;M district is a real thing and&nbsp;has three clubs in it. One that charges 50 euro for entry which includes two drinks and unlimited fun downstairs in private booths. It is identified by rainbow (gay) and black/blue/grey with a small red heart in the upper left (S&amp;M) flags.</li>
<li>The shortest time you buy is 15 minutes. This started because the nearby church bells ring every 15 minutes, making it easy to keep time without a watch.</li>
<li>Crazy is always free in Amsterdam.</li>
<li>Though you would buy 15 minutes, the average time spent with a girl is only 6 minutes. This doesn’t include negotiation, but does include undressing, a quick shower for the parts that matter, the act itself, and redressing.</li>
<li>There used to be male prostitutes in 2006. The Red Light District lobby wanted to do an experiment and&nbsp;see if there was a market for male sex workers in the city, so they put out an ad, “Wanted: Male Prostitutes”. They received 0 replies. Not discouraged, they put out another ad, “Wanted: Men who want to be paid to have sex with women”. They received 2 million replies, a fourth of Nederlands male population.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> On my third day in Amsterdam I met Paulien and she refuted the fourth point, saying that when she would serve coffee to the ladies she heard many a sad story for why they were working. One girl had been forced to work by her brother who took the money she made. Others were kept from leaving by men who first appear to be security for the girls and stand near the windows.</p>
<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p>I left the apartment at 9. I had found a bike rental shop online that was located behind Centraal Station. Two days for 12 euro was a great deal, especially for the black bell-ringing demon they set me up with. The ride was smooth as glass save the bumps in the brick streets. I took off down the dark red bike paths, fietspad, and eventually lost myself in a maze of buildings and shops. Dutch weather took a turn for the worse and the rain started coming down hard, so I took shelter in one of the shops.</p>
<p>While in the shop I tried something for the first time. I wasn’t really sure what to expect even though I’ve heard about it, smelled it, and have so many friends who enjoy it. I’m talking of course, about coffee. Aside from sips of friends Starbucks coffee smoothies, I had never tasted coffee. It was shockingly bitter. Lisa, the manager, was going to recommmend an espresso until I told her this would be my first coffee. She changed to drip coffee, insisting that the espresso would be like a punch in the face. I drank and talked with her while waiting for the rain to pass. She had just opened the shop two weeks ago with her boyfriend and was still feeling a mix of excitement and terror about how they would do. She had managed a restaurant before though, so I’m sure she’ll do fine with her own place.</p>
<p>By the last sip, the rain had passed and I headed out to keep exploring by bike. I stumbled upon an art market with sculptures, paintings, prints, and photos. Nothing caught my eye except for one, appropriately expensive, painting. I eventually ran into another market, this time on the Waterlopline, I didn’t expect to find. This one was the tip top of the four I would see that day. The booths were like miniature thrift shops, each had a unique set of wares for very cheap prices. There were trinket and clothing stands, but they made up the minority. In no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>African carvings and rugs</li>
<li>Leather bags, belts, boots, and wallets</li>
<li>Electronics: cables, cases, and batteries</li>
<li>Spray paint in all colors, 20-30 boxes of them</li>
<li>Jewelry, trinket, and bracelet stand blasting ACDC</li>
<li>Heavy duty rubber gas masks for 10 euro</li>
<li>Bikes and bike accessories: lights, locks, panniers, additional seats for small children, and tools</li>
<li>DVDs, both Hollywood movies and pornos (5 for 10 euro)</li>
<li>Lingerie</li>
<li>Books in Dutch and English</li>
<li>Hand made wool jackets.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last two markets, the Albert Cuyp markt, and the Dapper markt, were more fun to walk through than shop in. They reminded me of the Saturday morning market in Chico. I bought some presto, bread, and fruit to eat in the Vondlepark. After lunch, I biked through the Amsterdamse Bos and took pictures of planes as they passed overhead.</p>
<h2>Day 3</h2>
<p>I woke up at 8ish with bloodshot eyes. Even though the sun sets at 11 here doesn’t mean I should be up that late. After some Nutella and bread for breakast I&nbsp;headed out on bike. I was determined to shake a blue mood I had picked up overnight that was threatening to ruin the day. I&nbsp;don’t think I could have been any more sucessful. I biked to a few bike stores to check prices. I was, and still am, flirting with the idea of buying a bike and panniers and touring Europe by bike intead of train. I noticed on the train ride to Maastricht that bikes are allowed on trains. I could a bit of both.</p>
<p>However, after visiting two markets and a few shops, I had no answers. The brick and mortar bike stores would only be open on Monday. There was one last shop I had seen while biking between the markets yesterday on the west side of town, so I headed off. While passing by the Oosterpark I noticed a group of people wearing identical shirts and carrying ice coolers into the park. I had seen a few people earlier with those shirts but they had flowers in their hands and were passing them out to people in the markets I had been at. I wanted to know what all the fuss was about, so I hopped off my bike and followed them. They stoped in a group of 40-50 people all wearing the same blue shirts with white text in English, “Serve the city”.</p>
<p>I asked&nbsp;a man, William, what the gathing was for. He said it was a church lunch and I turned to leave, but he kept talking to me; asking where I was from and what I was up to in Amsterdam. I stayed to talk to him and went on to meet Paulien, Roberta, Annita, and a few others whose names escape me. We all ate, talked, and joked for 30-45 mintues. Their church is multi-denominational and that Sunday, instead of a service, they all went out and served the city. There were groups of people meeting with the elderly, feeding the homeless, handing flowers out, and picking up trash. They had been at it since early that morning and this was their celebration pot-luck. I asked them about cities between Amsterdam and Paris, and they unanimously recommended Maastricht. As our plates got emptier, Annita mentioned she had a pass for garden viewings across the city.</p>
<p>There are often hidden gardens within a block of apartments or homes that are only accessible through the homes. Once every year they are opened to the public if you have a special pass. I asked Paulien if she wanted to come with and we left a few minutes later. I locked my bike to the park fence and we took a tram to the Rembrantplein where we started walking from garden&nbsp; to garden, talking about everything in between. Paulien was a very charming and beautiful woman and it was the highlight of my day to walk around with her. As we were leaving what would be our last garden, she asked if I wanted to see another garden, or go get a drink. I immediately concluded that now was the time to try beer. We walked back to the Rembrandplein and sat at the Rembrandt Bar.</p>
<p>Heineken is now the reigning champion among bitter things I’ve tasted. The coffee comes in a close second. I mentioned that this was my first beer and she demanded my camera. The pictures are fantastic, but unfortunately I am without a cable to transfer photos from my camera to the tablet. I won’t be able to add pictures until I find one. I’ll try to find something in Maastricht in a camera store.</p>
<h2>Day 4</h2>
<p>After visiting the Anne Frankhuis at 9, we packed up and headed to Centraal Station to get tickets for Maastricht. We’re sitting in the corner room of La Colome in central Maastricht, about to get something to eat. We’ll be here for the night and will probably head on to Brugge tomorrow but we’re still not sure.</p>
<p>I’m planning to post each time we/I leave a city, so expect a post on Maastricht tomorrow or the next day.</p>
