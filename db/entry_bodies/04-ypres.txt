<h2>Day 7</h2>
<p>This was a resting day as we prepared for Paris tomorrow. We went for a short walk before the hotel allowed us to enter our room. The walking path followed the exterior wall do the city. Ieper was a major battleground in world war one and many smaller wars before then. There were many monuments to the fallen soldiers, and lots of old men in wheelchairs looking sullen and thoughtful.</p>
<p>I enjoyed a Belgian waffle with chocolate sauce and fresh whipped creme. For some reason, the line “Wait for the creme”, from Inglorious Basterds, kept repeating itself in my head.</p>
<p>The Last Post is performed every day at 20. Mom and I were at a nice cafe but there was a tour group in front of us so it was talking a long time to get our food. Once it arrived, it was 1950 and we had to rush to the mein gate. Mom produced plastic bags from her purse and we quickly stuffed the food into them. It was the most awkward I’ve felt yet, but it’s pretty funny in retrospect.</p>
