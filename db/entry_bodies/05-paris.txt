<p>I arrived in Paris completely exhausted. These are all the notes I took. As I’m several days behind already, I’m going to post these now and hopefully elaborate on them when I have some down time</p>
<h2>Day 8</h2>
<p>Arrival, wander the city and night party.</p>
<h2>Day 9</h2>
<p>Tour, wander the city, pizza</p>
<h2>Day 10</h2>
<p>Stay in, march alongside socialist party, watch windows get smashed.</p>
<h2>Day 11</h2>
<p>Stay in and read comic books</p>
