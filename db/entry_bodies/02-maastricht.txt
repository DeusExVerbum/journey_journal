<h2>Day 4</h2>
<p>The train to Maastricht had been two hours, but it was nice to relax and watch the Dutch countryside flow alongside us. Community gardens were frequent sights, as were pastures and office buildings. Groups of homes scattered the fields much like they do in California, except the fields are tan there, not a luscious green. Bike paths followed the train the whole way.</p>
<p>We left the station and walked a few blocks past closed shops. My map showed a cluster of hotels across the Maas. Mom suggested we check with the tourism office instead of my idea, which was to price check each hotel by foot. Good thing to &mdash; we got a good discount even with their booking fee. Our room was on the second floor of a cafe and looked out over a cobble square ruined by still more cafes and shops. We lightened our packs and headed out to get some food.</p>
<p>After eating and trying to avoid the rain that began falling very suddenly, we split to explore the city. Mom went off to see some shops she had noticed on the walk in, and I set off south unsure of exactly where I was headed. I passed Maastricht University and their conservatory which poured piano, violin and bass drum onto the streets. A park appeared before me and I laid down, closed my eyes, and listened to the techno music that someone was playing from some mp3 player speakers.</p>
<p>I awoke and wandered a while before arriving at the same bridge we had crossed over a few hours before. I ran into some energetic travelers who agreed to take a picture before making my way back to the hotel.</p>
