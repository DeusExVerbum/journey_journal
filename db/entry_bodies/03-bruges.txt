<h2>Day 5</h2>
<p>The train from Maastricht dropped us in Bruges early in the day with plenty of time to explore. We stopped in with tourist information to arrange our lodging and got lost twice before finding the place. Mom left to walk the town, looking for shops and thrift stores. I did the same, minus the shops. </p>
<p>Opting to walk south, I ran into two Turkish girls, Charlat and Frisile (I doubt I’m spelling these correctly), who told me about a small gathering they were on their way to in the nearby Astridpark. Nothing bad can happen in a park, so I agreed to meet them in 30-45 minutes. I was originally looking for a phone or camera store that may sell USB cables I could use to connect camera to tablet. Without it, the blog would be plain text until I got home, or found a kind soul with a laptop. After half an hour of searching, I cut my losses and headed back to the park.</p>
<p>The meeting was of the Bruges international university, or graduate school &mdash; I’m not entirely sure. They had arranged for an Italian actor currently staying in Bruges to perform a reading of Dante’s Divina Comedia. He had chosen five cantos to read, four from the first book and the last from the second. It was incredible to listen to him. They had him hooked up with a mic and speakers. You could feel the bass through the ground when he really got into it for Odysseus’&nbsp; speech to his men. </p>
<p>After the performance, I thanked him and set back off to find cables. I strolled past frequent tour groups being led by a man or woman holding a sign above their head so the flock would all stay together. It wouldn’t have been very hard to get lost. Most buildings, save the churches which were a mix of large stone blocks and brick, were make of identical fading brick that betrayed the city’s age.</p>
<p>After I had taken picture after picture of old buildings and streets, I escaped the center and walked along the Gent-Bruges canal. I came across a family fishing in the canal and asked if I could sit with them and watch. I had never seen the kind of fishing pole the father had set up. I’m afraid I came off as quite strange &mdash; sitting close, but not too close and without saying a word. I eventually tried to speak to Joseph, but his son Lorenzo explained that while his old man can under stand what I’m saying, he doesn’t know enough to speak back. Then began an enthralling series of conversations about:</p>
<ul>
<li>The differences between US and Belgian schooling (in which I let my bias against our insane system show through perhaps a bit to much)</li>
<li>Old US cars</li>
<li>Biking &mdash; featuring an appearance by the wannabe Armstrong himself</li>
<li>Fishing</li>
<li>Belgium and it’s cultural and linguistic diversity</li>
<li>My lack of a stereotypically American accent</li>
<li>Their specifically Belgian Dutch accent, as opposed to what I heard in Amsterdam</li>
<li>And much more I’m forgetting</li>
</ul>
<p>I left, took some pictures of windmills, and headed back to the hotel to sleep.</p>
<h2>Day 6</h2>
<p>I found cables! A three way coupling of USB cables is now able to transfer files from camera to tablet. I had been led out of the inner city by a nice man who thought there was a photography store across the canal, but I eventually found one within the city. I’m hoping to use this instead of the Raspberry Pi to back up my photos. This will also allow me to send the pictures I promised to the family I met yesterday and to Paulien.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I didn’t want to rent a bike, so I decided to walk north. I saw a group of students/young travelers and followed them at a distance in the most non-creepy way possible. They led me by a bookstore so I stopped in. I bought <em>The Fault In Our Stars</em>, by John Green. I dove into it and didn’t lift my head except to move to a different bench every hour is so. </p>
<p>I enjoyed it, though I’m at a loss for words to accurately describe why.&nbsp; The tragedy and comedy were good, but the characters also seemed like caricatures of the kind of the kind of&nbsp; unrealistic ‘kwirky-intelligence’ that has become popular lately. Regardless, it resonated with me in a way that I’m still trying to understand. I wanted the book to be deep and thoughtful and funny in the way I’ve heard it described and perhaps that is why it took me several hours after I finished it before I stopped feeling things, everything, with such intensity.</p>
<p>It merits another reading.</p>
<p>The book took up most of the day. It rained a few times while I was reading and the sky still looked unsure of its next move. I went to dinner with Mom, learned that asking for a to-go container gets you strange looks, and feel asleep soon after.</p>
